# Code for the paper "Pessimistic policy iteration with bounded uncertainty".
BUP is an uncertainty-based offline RL algorithm based on TD3 algorithm.

This code is built on the official [TD3_BC](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3_BC) repository and referred to the [EDAC](https://github.com/snu-mllab/EDAC) code for ensemble critic.

### usage
Running ```main_uncertain.py``` to reproduce the results in the paper:
